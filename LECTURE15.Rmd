# Parameter estimation for PVA!

We have now gone through the basic mechanics of population modeling. But we have barely discussed where the parameters come from!

This is the focus of the current lecture!


## Data requirements

### Scalar models
- Abundance (population size)
- Population growth rate 
- Temporal variation in population growth rate (environmentally induced fluctuations among years)
- Maximum rate of population growth
- Carrying capacity of the population (equilibrium abundance)

### Stage-structured (life history) models
- Abundance (population size)
- Vital rates (fecundity, survival, dispersal) 
- Temporal variation in vital rates (environmentally induced fluctuations among years) 
- Dependence of vital rates on density (e.g., how fecundity decreases as population gets more crowded)
- Maximum rate of population growth
- Carrying capacity of the population (equilibrium abundance)

### Metapopulation (spatial) models
- Spatial variation in vital rates (variation in different areas, subpopulations, or habitat patches)
- Dispersal rates among habitat patches
- Habitat requirements of different life stages
- Spatial distributions of suitable habitat, local populations or individuals
- Patterns of occupancy and extinction in habitat patches, or presence-absence data

## Data sources!

### Life tables

As you recall, life tables represent a single cohort that has been followed over time until the last one has died. 

NOTE: in practice, it is nearly impossible to follow a single cohort over time in the wild (although life tables are commonly available for captive populations). Therefore, in practice, most published life tables for wild populations use the **static life table**, which compares population size from multiple different cohorts, across the entire range of ages, at a single point in time. Static tables assume the population has a stable age structure —- that is, the proportion of individuals in each age class does not change from generation to generation,


```{r echo=FALSE}
lifetable <- read.csv("life_table.csv")
```

```{r results='asis', echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(lifetable,caption="",col.names = c("x","S(x)","b(x)","l(x)","g(x)"))

```

**PROS**
- Summary of survival and fecundity, often available in the literature. Be careful when using data from captive populations!

**CONS**
- Makes unrealistic assumptions (especially the *static life table* method).
- Can not estimate environmental stochasticity
- Can not estimate density dependence
- Ignores **imperfect detection** (assumes perfect detection)
- (remember, it's not always perfectly straightforward to translate into population model- but it can be done!)

### Census data!

Census data is ultimately what we all **wish** we had! It means we follow a population over time, and we know exactly how many individuals of each stage are in the population each year. We have *perfect detection!!!!*

In this case, computing survival and fecundity (and variation in these parameters, and density-dependence) is relatively straightforward!

![](census1.png)

![](census2.png)

![](census3.png)

**PROS**
- Can estimate survival and fecundity, env. stochasticity, density dependence- pretty much everything we want!

**CONS**
- Very rarely if ever available!
- Ignores **imperfect detection** (assumes perfect detection), which is probably not realistic.

### Capture-mark-recapture (CMR)

**PROS**
- Can estimate survival, variation in survival, lambda, dispersal rates. 
- Probably the most widely used source of data for population models!


**CONS**
- Few downsides, although the analytical techniques can be difficult to master
- Emigration and survival can be difficult to tease apart

See below for more! Also this is the main focus of the Population Dynamics course (the next course in the wildlife ecology and management sequence!)

### Data on spatial structure/habitat
- See [links](FINAL_PROJECTS.html) on Final projects page

### What if there's "no data"?

Remember the ["Stone Soup" analogy!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Soup)

- Use algebra to construct a full life table from available information
    - E.g., we are missing information on hatchling survival. We only know: 
        - Juvenile and adult survival rates 
        - Nesting success
        - Population growth (lambda) is 1.09
        - Now we can solve for hatchling survival!
- Simplify! (Models are always simplified representations of reality)
    - Ignore age structure? (i.e., use scalar model)
    - Ignore density-dependence?
    - Ignore trophic interactions (we usually make this simplification anyway!)
- Conservative strategies!
    - Density-independent is conservative
    - Under uncertainty, use the *worst case*
    - Under decline trends, use the worst case
- Use data from similar species!
   - E.g., tamarin species have similar life histories, so use data on golden lion tamarins to model golden-headed lion tamarins.
- Expert Opinion
    - See below... 
- National Databases
    - See [links](FINAL_PROJECTS.html) on Final projects page
- [Allometries](https://www.astronomyclub.xyz/maternal-effect/does-ecology-have-laws.html)
    - e.g., Fenchel's allometry
    - (also known as "Macroecology")

## Aside- is expert opinion okay to use???

- Not ideal, because it is hard or impossible to validate, and hard to document, but …
- That is what will be done in any case!
- And it is better to use it than to do nothing
- And it is better to document that expert opinion was used than to proceed with conservation planning in the absence of stating sources and assumptions
- It is a starting point (and sometimes a good one)



## Capture-mark-recapture (CMR) analysis


![](statistics1.png)

### PVA Parameters estimable from CMR data

- Survival rate
- Birth rate
- Abundance
- Lambda (rate of growth)
- Environmental effects on survival rate and fecundity
- Temporal process variance

### The data needed for CMR analysis: capture histories

Consider a project designed to monitor a population of alligators. These alligators were monitored for four years, from 1976 to 1979. 

Each row in the following table represents a unique possible history of captures:

A "1" indicates that an animal was successfully captured in a given year, and subsequently released. 

A "0" indicates that an animal was not successfully captured in a given year.

A "2" indicates that an animal was successfully captured in a given year but was not released back into the population.

![](caphist1.png)

### Two main types of CMR analyses

#### Closed population models
We assume that the population is closed to BIDE processes. That is, abundance does not change!
We attempt to estimate abundance!

- No mortality
- No births
- No immigration
- No emigration
- All individuals are observable

![](peterson1.png)

Parameters estimated:

- Abundance
- Capture probability 

M = the number of individuals marked in the first sample   
C = total number of individuals captured in 2nd sample   
R = number of individuals in 2nd sample that are marked   

We can use the following formula to estimate abundance (the **lincoln-peterson estimator**): 

$N = \frac{C*M}{R}$


#### Open population models
We assume that the population is open to one or more of the BIDE processes. That is, abundance CAN change! 
We attempt to estimate the processes driving abundance change (often, survival rates)

- Populations open to birth, death, and migration (abundance can change during the study).
- Enables estimation of the drivers of population dynamics over extended time periods 
- Often of great interest to ecologists and managers.


### Maximum likelihood: a framework for statistical inference!

**IN GENERAL**:
- Given an underlying *data-generating model*, what values of the model **parameters** maximize the probability of producing the observed data?
- To find the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) for an unknown **parameter** we usually take a starting value (e.g. survival=25%), and keep trying new values until the likelihood function is maximized (numerical optimization).

**FOR CMR ANALYSIS**:
- What value of survival maximizes the probability of generating the observed capture histories?

EXAMPLE:

Consider the following capture history for a single individual: 

```
1 0 1 1
```

This individual was marked and released upon initial capture. It was not captured in the next survey, but then was captured in each of the next two subsequent surveys.  

What is the probability of observing this capture history?

> [(Probability of surviving from time 1 to 2) X (Probability of not being seen at time 2)] X [(Probability of surviving from time 2 to 3) X (Probability of being seen at time 3)] X [(Probability of surviving from time 3 to 4) X (Probability of being seen at time 4)]

This can be written:

$L_1 = \phi_1(1-p_2) \cdot \phi_2p_3 \cdot \phi_3p_4$


How about the following capture history for a single individual: 

```
1 0 1 0
```

This individual was marked and released upon initial capture. It was then captured in the next survey, but was not detected in either of the final two surveys.  

What is the probability of observing this capture history?

> [(Probability of surviving from time 1 to 2) X (Probability of not being seen at time 2)] X [(Probability of surviving from time 2 to 3) X (Probability of being seen at time 3)] X

-- either -- 

>  [(Probability of surviving from time 3 to 4) X (Probability of not being seen at time 4)]

-- or --

>  [(Probability of NOT surviving from time 3 to 4) 

This can be written:

$L_1 = \phi_1(1-p_2) \cdot \phi_2p_3 \cdot \left \{(1-\phi_3)+\phi_3(1-p_4)  \right \}$

**Q**: if survival were 100% and capture probability were 100%, what is the probability of observing the above capture histories?

**Q**: what about if survival were 100% and capture probability were 75%? 

Maximum likelihood estimation is the process of finding those values of the parameters $\phi$ and $p$ that would be most *likely* to generate the observed capture histories!

This model is known as the *Cormack-Jolly-Seber* model (CJS), and is the basic analysis performed by Program MARK. 


**Q**: Why is $\phi$ also known as "apparent" survival? Why is it not "true" survival???

#### Assumptions of the CJS model

- All animals in population equally catchable at each sampling occasion (each sampling bout is a random sample from the population)
- All animals have same survival probability at each sampling occasion ($\phi_t$)
- Marks are not lost or missed by surveyors
- All emigration is permanent (equivalent to a mortality)

### Program MARK

MARK is a numerical maximum-likelihood engine designed for mark-recapture analysis. You input a capture history dataset and MARK will output results such as survival rate and capture probability!! 


## Example of an open-population mark-recapture analysis!

![](dipper1.png)

The European dipper data is THE classic example of a CMR dataset. Let's look at it!


```{r}
library(mra)
data("dipper.data")
head(dipper.data,10)

```


Here we use the "mra" package in R to do the ML parameter estimation!

```{r}
data(dipper.histories)
ct <- as.factor( paste("T",1:ncol(dipper.histories), sep=""))
attr(ct,"nan")<-nrow(dipper.histories)
dipper.cjs <- F.cjs.estim( ~tvar(ct,drop=c(1,2)), ~tvar(ct,drop=c(1,6,7)), dipper.histories )
cat("survival estimates!\n")
dipper.cjs$s.hat[1,] 

cat("\n\n detection probability estimates!\n")
dipper.cjs$p.hat[1,] 
```

What is our estimate for mean survival?

```{r}
mean(dipper.cjs$s.hat[1,],na.rm=T)
```

What is the environmental stochasticity?

```{r}
sd(dipper.cjs$s.hat[1,],na.rm=T)
```
