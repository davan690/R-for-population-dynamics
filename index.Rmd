# Overview{-#overview}

To begin with this model defines the life cycle of a species, then extended this to estimate population size and growth rate over a projected time frame and then analysis the elasticity and sensitivity of a matrix population model. I have done this with examples from my research on southern right whales and invasive species in NZ.

## What is Covered? {-}

The book is composed of six chapters intended to cover a suite of topics in introductory R programming. In general, the material builds in complexity from chapter to chapter and earlier chapters can be seen as prerequisites for later chapters. 

*  **Chapter \@ref(ch1)** covers the basics of working in R through RStudio, including the basics of the R coding language and environment.
*  **Chapter \@ref(ch2)** covers the basics of plotting using the base R graphics functionality. 
*  **Chapter \@ref(ch3)** covers the basics of fitting statistical models using built-in functionality for generalized linear models as well as non-linear models.   
*  **Chapter \@ref(ch4)** covers the basics of simulation modeling in R. 
*  **Chapter \@ref(ch5)** covers the basics of the `{dplyr}` and `{reshape2}` packages for manipulating and summarizing large data sets using highly readable code.
*  **Chapter \@ref(ch6)** covers the basics of producing maps and performing spatial analysis in R. _This chapter was contributed by Henry Hershey_

It is by no means comprehensive (no book about R ever could be), but instead attempts to introduce the main topics and develop the skills needed to get a beginner up and running with applying R to their own work in the context of population dynamics. Some of the courses were intended to be a companion to in-person workshop sessions. Although the examples shown have a natural resource/ecological theme, the general skills presented are general to R users across all scientific disciplines.
